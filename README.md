**Project Structure**

This project has three major parts :

model.py - This python file has a machine learning model which we build to predict Employee Attrition from 'Hr-Attrition' Dataset .

app.py - This contains Flask APIs that receives employee details through GUI or API calls, computes the precited value based on our model and returns it.

templates - This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to enter employee detail and displays the predicted employee will leave the organization OR not.
